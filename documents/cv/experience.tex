  \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
    \item Implemented a 6D pose detection algorithm capable of detecting drones with $<2$~cm of error
    \item Combined OpenCV, ROS2, Pytorch, and drone hardware in a single real-time project
    \item Created evaluation metrics and visualization tools to objectively monitor progress toward a complex goal
    % \item Utilized docker environments for portable and easy-to-set-up code for the future
    \item Standardized runtime environment docker containers decreasing code set up time from a day to $<$~an hour 
    \item Wrote and tuned a PID controller for a quadcopter drone capable of flying indoors in C++
  \end{cvitems}
  }
    

    % \item Created a 6D pose detection algorithm using pytorch and OpenCV
    % \item Created a real-time multi-drone tracking algorithm
